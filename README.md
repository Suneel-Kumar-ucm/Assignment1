1. Write a python program for the following: – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it. Sample input: •python •Sample output: •ntyp

SOLUTION: * Getting a word as input from user * Then deleting 2 characters from a word using : * Then reversing the resultant string by using the slice operator * 
Then displaying the final reversed string OUTPUT
Enter string suneel
The reversed string after removal of 2 characters: enus

1.2.Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.
SOLUTION: * Getting two integers from user inorder to perform the arithmetic operations * Performed addition, substractio, multiplication, division and then displayed those values 
OUTPUT: 
Enter 1st integer 5
Enter 2nd integer 2 
The addition of 2 values is 7 
The multiplication of 2 values is 10 
The substraction of 2 values is 3 
The division of 2 values is 2.5

2.Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’. •Sample input: •I love playing with python •Sample output: •I love playing with pythons

SOLUTION: * In this program the user enters the sentance which is include with python word
* Converting string to lowercase by using lower() function
* * Then used a "replace" function inorder to replace the "python" with "pythons" and stored it in string variable.
  * * Then displayed the sentance after the replacement with pythons...
    *
    * OUTPUT: Enter the sentance I love playing with python
    * The sentance after replacing i love playing with pythons

3.Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class.

SOLUTION: * Getting an percentage from user. * Based on percentage calculating the grade 
* If grade is greater than or equals to 90 and less than or equals to 100 then grade is A
* If grade is greater than or equals to 80 and less than 90 then grade is B
* If grade is greater than or equals to 70 and less than 80 then grade is C
* If grade is greater than or equals to 60 and less than 70 then grade is D
* If grade is greater than or equals to 0 and less than 60 then grade is F

 OUTPUT: Enter your percentage  81.5 
 Your grade is B
